# Perceptron
I tried to develop a simple perceptron (that is, one neuron) from scratch. It's mainly a test of my understanding
of what a perceptron is (based on the 1957 definition : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), and particularly
of my ability to develop it in a language I'm learning (Go).
