# Perceptron
I tried to develop a simple perceptron (that is, one neuron) from scratch. It's mainly a test of my understanding
of what a perceptron is (based on the 1957 definition : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), and particularly
of my ability to develop it in a language I'm learning (Go).

##TODO :

- [ ] Add the notion of layer
- [ ] Stack layers on top of each others
- [ ] Find a test set that can be used in that case
- [ ] Implement it
